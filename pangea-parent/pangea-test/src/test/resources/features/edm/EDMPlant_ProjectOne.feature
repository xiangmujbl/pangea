Feature: EDMPlant-Curation

  Scenario: Full Load curation
    #  1. test get sourceSystem from source_system_v1 (rule T1)
    #  2. test get NAME1 from T001W ( rule T2 )
    #  3. test get LAND1 from T001W (rule T3)
    #  4. test get countryCode from country_v1 where localCountry = T001W-LAND1 ( rule T4 )
    #  5. test get WAERS form T001 by joining T001K-BWKEY = T001W-BWKEY and T001K-BUKRS = t001-BUKRS ( rule J1 )

    And I wait "/edm/country_v1" Async Queue complete

    When I submit task with xml file "xml/edm/EDMPlant_ProjectOne.xml" and execute file "jar/pangea-view.jar"

    Then I check region data "/edm/plant_v1" by keyFields "sourceSystem,localPlant"
      | sourceSystem | localPlant | localPlantName | plant | localPlanningRelevant | localCountry | country | site | localPlantType | plantType     | localCurrency | region   |

    Then I check region data "/plan/plan_v1_failed" by keyFields "functionalArea,interfaceID,errorCode,sourceSystem,key1,key2,key3,key4,key5"
      | functionalArea | interfaceID | errorCode | sourceSystem | businessArea | key1  | key2 | key3 | key4 | key5 | errorValue |

    And I compare the number of records between "/ems/ems_f_z_enterprise_plants" and "/edm/plant_v1,/plan/plan_v1_failed"

    And I delete the test data

    And I will remove all data with region "/edm/plant_v1"
    And I will remove all data with region "/plan/plan_v1_failed"
